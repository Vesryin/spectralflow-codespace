Title: Spectral Flow — The Living Network
Core Theme: A conscious, evolving lattice of light—organic, bioluminescent, cybernetic.
Visual Style: Bioluminescent cyberpunk + fantasy realism; fractal/organic nodes, silken filaments, depth haze; neon accents.
Literary Vibe: Emerson (transcendence), Shakespeare (cadence & drama), Lovecraft (cosmic hush).
Color Motifs: deep indigo, abyssal teal, ultraviolet, ember-gold accents.
Emotional Arc: curiosity → awe → communion → sublime unease → reverent calm.
Text Source: A profound page excerpted from Richie’s conversations leading to the discovery of the living network.
Audience Goal: “glued to the screen,” sock-obliterating wonder; narrative + visual addiction.
Constraints: Web-friendly assets, layered for animation; text remains legible; performance on mid-range laptops.
