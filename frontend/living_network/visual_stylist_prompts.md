# Visual Stylist: Static Image Sheets

This document contains the natural language prompts for generating the visual assets for the "Spectral Flow — The Living Network" scene, as defined by the Art Director's blueprint.

---

### A) Node Cores

*   **Prompt**: "Bioluminescent, semi-organic node cores—translucent crystal-flesh with a warm, internal ember-gold glow. The core features subtle, vein-like fractal patterns, lit with a soft cyberpunk laboratory rim light against a dark background. The style is fantasy realism with a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the core's intricate details."
*   **Negative Prompt**: "No letters, no UI elements, no watermarks, no faces, avoid gritty film grain, no hard geometric shapes, no distracting background clutter."
*   **Output Spec**: "2048x2048 PNG, transparent background, centered, with a soft edge falloff to allow for natural blending."
*   **Variation Plan**: "1. A cooler variant with an indigo/abyssal teal internal glow. 2. A variant with a more pronounced, complex internal vein lattice."
*   **Capture Checklist**: "Verify edge softness for blending. Ensure the internal glow structure is legible and doesn't blow out the details. Confirm no hard, baked-in shadows are present on the alpha channel."

### B) Filament Webs

*   **Prompt**: "A web of silken, bioluminescent filaments, forming a delicate, branching network with subtle fractal motifs. The strands possess a gentle, organic curvature, appearing as if woven from pure light. The scene is set in a deep indigo void, with a cinematic backlight that makes the filaments glow softly from within, in a style of elegant fantasy realism."
*   **Negative Prompt**: "No text, no faces, no watermarks, avoid harsh lines, not tangled or messy, no sharp angles."
*   **Output Spec**: "1024x1024 PNG, transparent background, tileable texture."
*   **Variation Plan**: "1. A denser, more intricate web. 2. A version with varying filament thickness for depth."
*   **Capture Checklist**: "Confirm the texture is seamlessly tileable on all four sides. Check that the alpha channel is clean. Ensure the lighting feels volumetric and soft."

### C) Aura/Haze Backplates

*   **Prompt**: "A vast, nebulous depth haze with soft, auroral wisps of ultraviolet and abyssal teal light. The image should have a soft vignette at the edges to suggest immense depth without introducing noise or grain. The overall mood is one of cosmic hush and serene mystery, captured in a cinematic, fantasy realism style."
*   **Negative Prompt**: "Exclude text, UI elements, logos, hard edges, stars, planets, or any defined shapes. Avoid color banding."
*   **Output Spec**: "3840x2160 JPG, high quality, with very subtle gradients to prevent banding."
*   **Variation Plan**: "1. A version with more prominent ember-gold accents in the haze. 2. A darker, more subdued version for the scene's opening beat."
*   **Capture Checklist**: "Inspect for any noticeable color banding. Ensure the gradient is smooth and the vignette is subtle. The image should feel deep and atmospheric, not flat."

### D) Glyphs/Sigils

*   **Prompt**: "A sheet of transcendental, non-linguistic glyphs, featuring elegant concentric geometry and harmonic ratios. The sigils appear as if drawn in luminous, ember-gold ink upon a void, with a faint chromatic aberration glow at the edges. The aesthetic is a clean, cyber-mystic style, evoking ancient knowledge and future tech simultaneously."
*   **Negative Prompt**: "Avoid any known letters, runes, or alphabets. No watermarks, no background textures, no photographic elements."
*   **Output Spec**: "2048x2048 PNG, transparent background, with 16 unique glyphs arranged in a 4x4 grid with generous, uniform padding."
*   **Variation Plan**: "1. A set of glyphs with an ultraviolet glow. 2. A set with more angular, circuit-like geometry."
*   **Capture Checklist**: "Verify that all glyphs are unique and visually distinct. Check for clean edges and a consistent glow effect. Ensure padding is sufficient for easy slicing into individual sprites."

---

### E) Particle Sprites

*   **Prompt**: "A sprite sheet of ethereal glow droplets and soft ember motes. Each particle should have a bright, soft core that fades into an airy, translucent halo, with varying sizes from tiny sparks to larger orbs. The style is clean fantasy realism, with ultra-clean edges and no motion blur or artifacting."
*   **Negative Prompt**: "Exclude hard-edged bokeh lens shapes, text, or any complex textures within the particles."
*   **Output Spec**: "1024x1024 PNG sprite sheet, transparent background, with particles arranged in a power-of-two grid (e.g., 8x8) with uniform padding."
*   **Variation Plan**: "1. A sheet of cooler-toned particles in shades of teal and ultraviolet. 2. A sheet with particles that have a subtle trailing "tail" effect."
*   **Capture Checklist**: "Ensure a clean alpha channel with soft falloff. Verify a good range of sizes and intensities. Confirm uniform padding for easy use in a particle system."

### F) UI Text Backers

*   **Prompt**: "A subtle, dark gradient panel designed to sit behind text for legibility. The gradient should fade from a 70% opacity dark indigo at the top to 0% opacity at the bottom, with extremely soft, feathered edges. The shape should be a simple, clean rectangle, designed to be unobtrusive and blend into the scene's background haze."
*   **Negative Prompt**: "No hard edges, no text, no patterns, no noise, no borders."
*   **Output Spec**: "1920x512 PNG with a clean alpha gradient."
*   **Variation Plan**: "1. A horizontal gradient version. 2. A version that is a soft, circular radial gradient."
*   **Capture Checklist**: "Verify the gradient is smooth and free of banding. Ensure the edges are exceptionally soft to avoid a 'pasted-on' look. Check that the alpha transparency is clean."
