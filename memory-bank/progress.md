Completed: 
- Rung 1: Foundation - Backend Stability
  - Audited and organized backend code into a modular FastAPI application.
  - Defined Pydantic models for core data structures.
  - Implemented a service layer to separate business logic from API endpoints.
  - Conceptually defined MCP server schemas.
- Rung 2: Core Functionalities (In Progress)
  - Implemented initial MCP server integration with simulated model calls and fallback logic.
  - Implemented Phase 1 of persistent context handling with a `ConversationManager`.

Remaining: 
- Rung 2: Core Functionalities (Continued)
  - Basic Voice Pipeline
- Rung 3: Personality & UX
- Rung 4: Deployment & Monitoring
- Rung 5: Growth & Refinement

Known issues: The current context management uses in-memory storage and a JSON file, which is not suitable for production. The next step will be to migrate to Redis and a vector database as outlined in the plan.

Evolution notes: The backend has evolved from a tangled prototype into a clean, scalable foundation. The MCP service provides a solid starting point for model interaction.
