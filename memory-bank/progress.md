Completed: 
- Rung 1: Foundation - Backend Stability
  - Audited and organized backend code into a modular FastAPI application.
  - Defined Pydantic models for core data structures.
  - Implemented a service layer to separate business logic from API endpoints.
  - Conceptually defined MCP server schemas.
- Rung 2: Core Functionalities (Completed)
  - Implemented initial MCP server integration with simulated model calls and fallback logic.
  - Implemented Phase 1 of persistent context handling with a `ConversationManager`.
  - Implemented the Basic Voice Pipeline with local STT/TTS models.
- Rung 3: Personality & UX (In Progress)
  - Completed comprehensive design and technical planning for "The Living Network."
  - Implemented the foundational WebGL scene for "The Living Network."
  - Added data loading for the network graph and narrative.
  - Implemented the "Node Pulse" animation.
  - Implemented advanced shaders (GLSL) for nodes and filaments, creating dynamic, time-based animations.
  - Added user interaction (Three.js Raycaster) for displaying narrative content on hover and click.

Remaining: 
- Rung 3: Personality & UX
  - "The Living Network" Scene: Refine user interaction and narrative presentation.
- Rung 4: Deployment & Monitoring
- Rung 5: Growth & Refinement

Known issues: The current context management uses in-memory storage and a JSON file, which is not suitable for production. The next step will be to migrate to Redis and a vector database as outlined in the plan.

Evolution notes: The backend has evolved from a tangled prototype into a clean, scalable foundation. The MCP service provides a solid starting point for model interaction.
