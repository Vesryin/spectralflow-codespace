Current tasks: Deploying the application to Vercel and Railway.

Recent changes: Configured the frontend to fetch data from a live backend instead of local files. Prepared the project for deployment.

Next steps: Deploy the backend to Railway, deploy the frontend to Vercel, and update the frontend with the live backend URL.

Learnings & patterns: The service-oriented architecture is proving effective. The `mcp_service` provides a clean abstraction for interacting with different AI models.
