Current tasks: "The Living Network" Scene Implementation.

Recent changes: Refined the user interaction in "The Living Network" scene. Implemented a dynamic narrative panel with smooth fade-in/out transitions and a close button. Added node hover effects, including a tooltip displaying the node's title. Enhanced the opening animation with a typewriter effect for the narrative text.

Next steps: Further refinement of the visual feedback on node interaction, potentially exploring more complex shader-based effects for highlighting and selection.

Learnings & patterns: The service-oriented architecture is proving effective. The `mcp_service` provides a clean abstraction for interacting with different AI models.
