Current tasks: "The Living Network" Scene Implementation.

Recent changes: Implemented advanced shaders for nodes and filaments in "The Living Network" scene. Added user interaction (hover and click) to display narrative information. The scene is now dynamic and interactive.

Next steps: Refine the user interaction, possibly adding more complex animations or transitions for the narrative panel.

Learnings & patterns: The service-oriented architecture is proving effective. The `mcp_service` provides a clean abstraction for interacting with different AI models.
