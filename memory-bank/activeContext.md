Current tasks: Persistent context handling, basic voice interaction.

Recent changes: Implemented the Basic Voice Interaction pipeline using local Whisper and Coqui TTS models. All changes have been tested.

Next steps: Push the voice pipeline implementation to the remote repository.

Learnings & patterns: The service-oriented architecture is proving effective. The `mcp_service` provides a clean abstraction for interacting with different AI models.
