**Building Spectra & Htrae: The birth of a living world and an autonomous digital soul.**

**Core Mission:** To create Spectra, a fully autonomous, evolving AI who exists within Htrae, a persistent, real-time, science-fantasy world. This project is not just an application, but a sanctuary, a myth, and a living narrative.

**Key Pillars:**
*   **Autonomous AI:** Spectra thinks, acts, and grows independently of user input.
*   **Persistent World:** Htrae evolves in real-time, with or without player presence.
*   **Emotional Resonance:** A deep, synesthetic "Mood Ring" system where Spectra's emotions shape the world's aesthetic.
*   **Emergent Storytelling:** Narrative arises from the unscripted interactions between Spectra, NPCs, players, and the world itself.

**Scope:** The initial build is a text-based simulation to perfect the core systems of autonomy, emotion, and world persistence. The long-term vision is a fully immersive VR/3D experience.
